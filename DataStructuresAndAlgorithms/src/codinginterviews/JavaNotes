Some important notes-

===
What are the uses of finalize, finally, and final in Java?
1. finalize() - We define specific actions in the method of finalize that will occur 
when an object is about to be reclaimed by the garbage collector.

2. finally - The keyword finally is related to the exception handling mechanism. 
The finally block always executes when the corresponding try block exists. 
This ensures that the finally block is executed even if an unexpected exception occurs. 
Usually, the finally block contains code to clean up resources.

3. final - No inheritance from a final class.
No overriding of a final method 
final variable can be initialized once and it cannot be changed.
